# Based on the Avon SCRTP cluster at Warwick, but suitable for any system using a
# full Intel stack, i.e. icc/ifort + Intel MPI and MKL, noting that mpif90, mpicc
# etc will wrap gfortran and gcc (not ifort and icc) and link with Intel MPI on
# such systems.

# Tested with environment modules...

# Use MKL by default. ScaLAPACK is also available so might as well use it.
